4) Environment 
    [ ] 4.1 Quick fix to remove the intro (it'll come back later)
    [ ] 4.2 Ensure pathing is right
    
Remove the first 2 necromancers
New summons:
    - Zombie: same
    - Ghoul: gets the role of the swordsman (no more slow)
    - Magician: gets slow and deals more damage - and become more rare, so they become higher priority
    - Archer: same
    - swordsman: Remove

The 3 apprentices have to be killed before you destroy the cauldron

Cauldron is destroyed: he ress the apprentices, but they don't have any special abilities
He will however death pact them when he reaches 50% hp, so kill him them off
Morbent still have DnD and DC

3rd phase: Less ghosts, with more hp (picks the one with the most hp)
He drains the ghosts instead of just "death pacting" them,
Perhaps some aoe (like the dnd) here as well.
Perhaps make the ghosts explode on death


Hard mode??????


Lore:
A Necromancer who is pissed at the village, and thus he wishes to destroy it. He has picked up the magic of death,
in order to do this. He has overtaken the graveyard, and performs wicked rituals.

The Necromancer, perhaps have some merit for his opinion towards the village. 

Magic of Death: Ordinarily undeads and spirits are not a evil beings, but very neutral and rarely inteferes with the living.
However, Magic of Death is the art of controlling and harvesting these unused powers. It's a magic that is rare
but usually used for communicating and honoring the dead. However, some use it for their own agenda and purpose,
defying the dead, and controls them.
